# Less Fog

Module to enhance visibility for the GM and players in Foundry VTT.  Below is the default view in FVTT, showing explored and unexplored areas **without** the `lessfog` module.

The `lessfog` module tweaks the light levels and shadow blur in the player view below.

In the GM view below, the `lessfog` module reveals (to the GM only) any unexplored areas, as well as tokens anywhere on the canvas.  A configuration option allows all players to see unexplored areas and tokens just like the GM (option off by default).

For the GM only, the module also adds a button to the Token controls on the left side of the screen that will toggle the entire FOW on and off.  This button replicates a similar function that appeared in older versions (before 2.6.1) of the [Furnace module](https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/fvtt-module-furnace).
